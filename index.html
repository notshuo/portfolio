                        <h4>Web Development</h4>
                        <p>For one of our school group projects, a client requested an online website for his new business.
                             We developed a responsive e-commerce website, which included both an admin page and a user page,
                              and successfully uploaded it to the internet. Additionally, I designed a simple e-commerce cake website using HTML,
                               CSS, and JavaScript as part of another school project.
                                This experience gave me valuable hands-on knowledge in creating fully functional websites that are both user-friendly and visually appealing.

                        <h4>Graphic Design</h4>
                        <p>In the field of graphic design, I created a logo and edited a video project in a school subject to enhance the visual effects for a presentation.
                             I also created a 3D model to visually represent our concept and improve the overall presentation.
                              For a seminar we conducted at school, I design a social media poster, webinar banner,
                               and promotional banner to ensure the event ran smoothly.

                        <h4>Mini Projects</h4>
                        <p>In terms of mini projects, I developed a mini calculator and a mini-game using Python.
                             We also built a simple device using Arduino and ESP-32 that detects loud motor mufflers and saves the data into Google Sheets.
                              Furthermore, I created a computer simulation on Packet Tracer that connects all the networks inside a computer shop using various topologies.
